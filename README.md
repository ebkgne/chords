# chords

cross string instrument tuning 

ukele,cuatro,guitare,banjo,tres,.. in any tuning

as a person with no music theory background I always had hardtime understanding how chords work on a string instruments, but one day I discovered the quite simple diatonic scale and understood that all western music is based on that 

so I came up with this tool to understand chords the whole instruments neck in a way that is more fit to me than good old tabs sheets.

its pure VanillaJS
