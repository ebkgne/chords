cross chord instrument tuning 

ukele,cuatro,guitare,banjo,tres,.. in any tuning

as a person with no music theory background I always had hardtime understanding how chords are made on a guitare or so, nur one day I discovered the quite simple diatonic scale and understood that all western music is based on that 

so I came up with this tool wich translate in a methodology to understand the instruments neck in a way that is more fit to me, and maybe you .

pure VanillaJS
